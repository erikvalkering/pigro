# Features
- easy creation of cached functions
- reactivity by specifying dependencies
- support for values, functions, and lazy functions as dependencies
- skipping re-evaluation if dependencies evaluate to same values as previous ones
- skipping comparison of lazy function dependencies if they were not re-evaluated
- memory optimization for void functions

# Roadmap
- memory optimization for stateless dependencies
- memory optimization for dependencies (only store cached result and any stateful transitive dependencies
